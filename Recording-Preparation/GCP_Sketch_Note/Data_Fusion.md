# Bridge data silos with Data Fusion

## Goal
- A huge challenge with data analytics is that the data is all over the place and is in different formats. As a result, you often need to complete numerous integration activities before you can start to gain insights from your data.

## What is Data Fusion ?
- Data Fusion offers a one-stop-shop for all enterprise data integration activities including ingestion, ETL, ELT and Streaming and with an execution engine optimized for SLAs and cost

## Data integration capabilities
- Data Fusion supports a broad set of more than 200 connectors and formats, which enables you to extract and blend data You can develop data  pipelines in a  visual environment to improve productivity
- Data Fusion provides data wrangling capabilities to  prepare data and provides capabilities to operationalize the data wrangling to improve business IT collaboration 
- You can leverage the extensive REST API to design, automate, orchestrate and manage the lifecycle of the pipelines .
- Data Fusion supports all data delivery modes including batch, streaming or  real-time making it a comprehensive platform to address both batch and streaming related use cases.
- It provides operational insights so that you can monitor data integration processes. Manage SLAâ€™s and help optimize and fine tune integration jobs.
- Data Fusion provides capabilities to parse and enrich unstructured data using Cloud AI, for example, converting audio files to text, applying NLP to detect sentiment, or extracting features from images and documents or converting HL7 to FHIR formats

## Data consistency
- minimizes the risk of mistakes by providing structured ways of specifying transformations, data quality checks with `Wrangler`, and predifined directives
- help identify quality issues by keeping track of profiles of data
- Data formats change over time, data fusion helps handle data with the ability to identify change and customize error handling 

## Open, hybrid and multi-cloud
Data Fusion is `cloud-native and powered by CDAP`, a 100% open-source framework for building on-premises and cloud data analytics applications . This means you can deploy and execute integration pipelines in different environments without any changes to suit business needs.

## Data protection
Data protection ensures data security in the following ways :
- it provides secure access to on-premises data with private IP
- it encrypts data at rest by default or with Customer Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) to control across all user data in supported storage systems.
- it provides data exfiltration protection via VPC Service Controls,  a security perimeter around platform resources.
- you can store sensitive passwords, URLs, and JDBC strings in Cloud KMS, and integrate with external KMS systems.
- it integrates with Cloud DLP to mask, redact, and encrypt data in transit.
