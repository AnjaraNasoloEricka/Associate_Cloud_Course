# Use cases, security, pricing and more about Compute Engine 

## How does it work ? 
You can create a VM via a : 
- boot disk image 
- boot disk snapshot 
- container image 

### Best practices 
- Use snapshot schedules (hourly, daily, or weekly) as a best practice to back up your Compute Engine workloads

## Security 
- Default hardware security 
- Using `Identity and Access Management (IAM)` you just have to ensure that proper permissions are given to control access to your VM resources
