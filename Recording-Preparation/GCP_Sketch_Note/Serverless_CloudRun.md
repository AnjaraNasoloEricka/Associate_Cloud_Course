# Cloud Run 

## How to use Cloud Run ?
With Cloud Run, you write your code in your favorite language and/or use a binary library of your choice. Then push it to Cloud Build to create a container build. With a single commandâ€”**gcloud run deploy**-you go from a container image to a fully managed web application that runs on a domain with a TLS certificate and auto-scales with requests.
