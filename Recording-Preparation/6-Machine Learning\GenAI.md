# 6 - Machine Learning / GenAI

## Evolution of AI capabilitiÃ©s and tools 
1. **Predictive AI** : 
    - Regression & Classification Forecasting 
    - Sentiment Analysis 
    - Entity Extraction 
    - Object Detection 
2. **Generative AI** 
    - Text, Image & Code Generation 
    - Text & Code Rewriting & Formatting 
    - Summarization 
    - Extractive Q&A
    - Image & Video Description
3. **Multimodal Generative AI**
    - Natural Image Understanding 
    - Video Question Answering 
    - Automatic Speech Recognition & Translation 
    - Spatial Reasoning and Logic 
    - Mathematic Reasoning in Visual Context 

## Introducing AI @ Google - Predicive AI 
Cloud AI has multiple way of consumption : 
- Out of the box : 
    - Pre-trained API & AI Agents (e.g : Cloud Vision API)
- Custom AI (Your data trained with Google's model) with BigQuery ML or AutoML 
- DIY (You create your own model - From scratch): 
    - Vertex AI End-to-End AI with core tools

### Vertex AI for ML 
#### Vertex AI pre-trained model 
- **Vision :**
    - Vision, AutoML Vision, Video Intelligence, AutoML Video Intelligence
- **Language :**
    - Translation, AutoML Translation, Natural Language, AutoML Natural Language
- **Conversation :**
    - Dialogflow, Speech-To-Text, Text-To-Speech, Speaker ID
- **Structured data :**
    - AutoML tables, Fleet Routing API, Vertex AI Forecast, Tabnet, Timeseries insights API 

#### Vertex AI : unified development and deployment platform for data science and machine learning

### BigQuery ML 
- **What ?** SQL interface to Vertex

#### Process Schema 
Instead of exporting data to Vertex, BigQuery ML simplify the process by training and deploying the model

Example :

#### Features & capabilities 
![alt text](img/bqml_features.png)

#### Insights from unstructured data right inside BigQuery 
- You can also use `unstructured data in BigQuery` such as `images, docs, text` on BigQuery or Cloud Storage even if BigQuery is known for his SQL Query


### AutoML 

#### How (Process) ?
You just need to : 
- define data, % for training, % for evaluation, % for last test
- AutoML will test it with a lot of model and will show you the best model for it with accuracy 
- after that you can use that as an API

    - is a family lightweight, state-of-the-art open models built from the same research and technology used to create Gemini 

#### Vertex AI Model Builder

- Temperature of model : Model creativity 
- Output token : size of gemini output 
- Safety settings 

##### MLOps 
- **Purpose :** Create a pipeline to train model automatically

##### What? 
- It means : 
    - Prompt | Tune | Serve | Distill | Eval | Notebook | Training | Feature Store | Monitoring


#### Vertex AI Agent Builder

- Ground : limit 
- Search engine scraping in your own website

### Tuning in Vertex AI 
- Tuning means improving the existing model for example by using your own data 

#### Types : 
- Prompt design 
- Supervised tuning 
- Distillation 
- RLHF (Reinforcement learning from human feedback) 
    - it means that you tell if the output of the prompt is OK or not 
- Full fine tuning
