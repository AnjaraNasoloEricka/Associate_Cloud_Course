# Cloud Function

## What is Cloud Function ? 
- a lightweight, event-based, asynchronous compute solution that allows you to create small, single-purpose functions that respond to cloud events, without the need to manage a server or a runtime environment.

## Why do we need Cloud Function ? 
- construct application workflows from individual business logic tasks
- connect and extend cloud services
- Events from Cloud Storage and Pub/Sub can trigger Cloud Functions asynchronously, or you can use HTTP invocation for synchronous execution.
