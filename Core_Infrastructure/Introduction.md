# Introduction to Google Cloud

## What is Cloud Computing ? 
- Way of using Information Technology (IT) that has these 5 equally important traits : 
    1. No need for human intervention 
        - Customers get computing resources that are on-demand and self-service
        - Example : users get the processing power, storage, and network through a web interface 
    2. Customers get access to those resources over the internet, from anywhere they have a connection
    3. The cloud provider has a big pool of those resources and allocates them to users out of that pool: 
        - That allows the provider to buy in bulk and pass the savings on to the customers
        - Customers don't have to know or care about the exact physical location of those resources.
    4. The resources are elastic–which means they’re flexible, so customers can be.
        - Those resources are scalable
    5. Customers pay only for what they use, or reserve as they go

## Why is the cloud model so compelling nowadays?

### History of Cloud Computing 
- First wave known as `Colocation`
    - gave users the financial efficiency of renting physical space instead of investing in data center
- Second wave : Virtualized Data Center 
    - The components of virtualized data centers match the physical building blocks of hosted computing—servers, CPUs, disks, load balancers, and so on—but now they’re virtual devices.
    - With virtualization, enterprises still maintain the infrastructure; but it also remains `a user-controlled and user-configured environment`.

- Third wave : Container-based architecture 
    - A fully automated, elastic third-wave cloud that consists of a combination of automated services and scalable data.
    - Services automatically provision and configure the infrastructure used to run applications.
