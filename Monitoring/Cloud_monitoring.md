- Dynamically configures monitoring after resources are deployed and has intelligent defaults that allow you to easily create charts for basic monitoring activities

- Allows you to monitor your platform, system, and application metrics by ingesting data, such as metrics, events, and metadata. You can then generate insights from this data through dashboards, charts, and alerts

- Configure and measure uptime and health checks that send alerts via email

## Metric scope

A metrics scope is the root entity that holds monitoring and configuration information in Cloud Monitoring.
