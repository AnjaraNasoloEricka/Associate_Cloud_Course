# Logging and Error Reporting

## Logging

Cloud Logging allows you to store, search, analyze, monitor, and alert on log data and events from Google Cloud and AWS.

Logging includes storage for logs, a user interface called Logs Explorer, and an API to manage logs programmatically.

## Features of Cloud logging

- Read and write log entries
- Search and filter your logs
- Create `log-based metrics`

> Note : You can export your logs in BigQuery and import it in Looker Studio to visualize data

## Error Reporting

Error Reporting is a service that helps you diagnose and debug issues in your application by providing detailed error reports

Error Reporting **counts, analyzes, and aggregates the errors** in your running cloud services.

## Tracing

Cloud Trace is a distributed tracing system that **collects latency data** from your applications and displays it in the Google Cloud console.

Cloud Trace automatically analyzes all of your application's traces to generate in-depth latency reports that surface performance degradations and can capture traces from App Engine, HTTP(S) load balancers, and applications instrumented with the Cloud Trace API.

## Profiler

Cloud Profiler continuously analyzes the performance of CPU or memory-intensive functions executed across an application.

It runs accross all production instances.
