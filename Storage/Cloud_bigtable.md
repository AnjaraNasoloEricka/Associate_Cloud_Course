# Cloud BigTable

Cloud Bigtable is `Google's NoSQL big data database service`.

## Bigtable is designed to : 
- handle massive workloads
- consistent low latency
- high throughput
- data are sorted as `key/value` map
- throughput scales linearly

## Why choosing BigTable ? 
- They’re working with more than 1TB of semi-structured or structured data
- Data is fast with high throughput, or it’s rapidly changing.
- They're working with NoSQL Data
- Data is a time-series or has natural semantic ordering.
- They’re working with big data, running asynchronous batch or synchronous real-time processing on the data
- they’re running machine learning algorithms on the data.
- Cloud Bigtable integrates easily with popular big data tools like Hadoop, Cloud Dataflow, and Cloud Dataproc. Plus, Cloud Bigtable supports the open source industry standard **HBase API**,
